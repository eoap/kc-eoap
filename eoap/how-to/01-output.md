# How to return an output file

## Questions

- Where does the output of a command go?
- How can I save the output of a command?

## Objectives

- Learn how to describe and handle outputs from a tool.

## Explanation 

The `outputs` of a tool is a list of output parameters that should be returned after running the tool. Each parameter has an `id` for the name of parameter, and `type` describing what types of values are valid for that parameter.

When a tool runs under CWL, the starting working directory is the designated output directory. The underlying tool or script must record its results in the form of files created in the output directory. The output parameters returned by the CWL tool are either the output files themselves, or come from examining the content of those files.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to return a file generated by `gdal_translate`.

`cwltool return-output-file.cwl return-output-file.yml`{{execute}}

`ls -l preview.png`{{execute}}

## Key points

- Outputs are described in the `outputs` section of a CWL description:

`tail -n +8 return-output-file.cwl | head -n 4`{{execute}}

- The field `outputBinding` describes how to to set the value of each output parameter.

- Wildcards are allowed in the glob field.
